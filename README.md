# Subsidies+ Docs

Player guide for the Transport Fever 3 mod Subsidies+: when each subsidy is offered, what it asks for, and what you
get or lose, recalculated for the difficulty and game year you pick.

## Build

```
python make_icons.py <path to darthbane426_subsidies_plus/content/subventions> icons.js
python build.py
```

`template.html` is the source. `build.py` puts the icons in and writes `index.html`, the page GitHub Pages serves.
Run `make_icons.py` again only when the mod's icons change (needs Pillow).

The amounts follow the mod's constants, which are written into the `MOD` object and the rules in `template.html`.
When the mod's numbers change, update them there and rebuild.
